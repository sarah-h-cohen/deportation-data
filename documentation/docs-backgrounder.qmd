title: "Understanding the immigration enforcement system"

I'm not going to go into much detail here, but it's worth understanding a few key things about how the immigration removal system works.

There are two main agencies within the Department of Homeland Security that deal with illegal immigration. Customs and Border Patrol, or CBP, only operates within 50 miles of an international border, including the coastline. The people they deal with are usually those who have crossed the border illegally, not those who have presented themselves at the border and requested asylum.

The other agency is Immigration and ? Enforcement, or ICE. They operate in the interior of the country and are responsible for cases that have already been heard by an immigration court judge. Immigration court is completely separate from the U.S district court or a state criminal court -- it is staffed by Justice Department employees, not people who work for an independent judiciary. Its only job is to determine whether or not someone should be "removed", or sent back to their home countries or, in rare cases, some other country.

Both ICE and CBP can arrest people, but they are brought to immigration, not criminal, courts and are detained by ICE, not the US Bureau of Prisons. (The people arrested may also face charge in criminal court brought by a US attorney, but that is not really part of the immigration system).

People come to the removal system in several different ways:

* CBP transfers the person to ICE custody to face removal proceedings.
* ICE gets a fingerprint match from a criminal arrest anywhere in the country by any police department, even if they entered the country legally.
* An asylum seeker presents themselves to immigration court to ask for protection from political violence at home.
* ICE conducts raids on workplaces and checks each employee's visa status.

If an immigration judge has decided that someone should be removed, they become part of the immigration docket.

Each of these situations is obviously a little different, but the data compiled by the Deportation Data Project generally only refers to people ICE has had some contact with , and usually only who that appear on the docket. The officers can go out looking for people who should be on their docket. They can also request cooperation from state and local authorities, or raid an area and place people on the docket who don't have the proper authority to be here.

Here are a few resources to learn more about how the system works:

* [Explainer: How immigrants end up on ICE's non-detained docket](https://www.borderreport.com/immigration/explainer-how-immigrants-end-up-on-ices-non-detained-docket/), from Border Report. This is broader than it seems, and requires reading all the way through because there's a lot of "yes, but" items in it. In particular, it takes apart the claim that ICE has released tens of thousands of violent criminals because they're not in "detention". (Answer: They may well be in prison somewhere -- they're just not in ICE custody.)
