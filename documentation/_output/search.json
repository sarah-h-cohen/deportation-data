    "text": "Definitions\n\nERO administrative arrests\nThe Deportation Data project is acquired from ICE, and refers to “ERO administrative arrests”.\nIn his series “A close look at ICE arrest data..”, Austin Kocher says that the Deportation Data Project’s arrest data is actually administrative arrests reported by ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations. This excludes CBP, HSI, and non-administrative arrests, he says. It suggests it excludes people caught up in protests or arrested without immigration orders.\nGenerally, ICE’s ERO arrests people with civil immigration law violations - they’re based on administrative arrest warrents. A CRS report says they can make arrests in two instances when they don’t have a warrant: 1) The alien is attempting to enter the country, 2) the officer has “reason to believe” the immigrant is here unlawfully and will escape if not arrested.\nThis second exception suggests that ICE just has to say, “I think you’re here unlawfully” and they can arrest without a warrant. These are the brief stops now called “Kavanaugh stops” because he said that using a broad definition here, even racial profiling, can fall under that exception.\n\n\nFinal program\nThe original data has 14 “final program” entries that can be lumped together into the following four categories, roughly following the guide used in the footnote on Page 25 of the Migration Policy Institute’s 2018 paper, “Revving up the Deportation Machinery”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew category\nIncludes\n\n\n\n\nCriminal justice system\nERO Criminal Alien Program (CAP) ; 287G Program; 287g Task Force; ERO Criminal Prosecutions\n\n\nNon-detained docket\nAlternatives to Detention; Non-Detained Docket Control; Juvenile\n\n\nDetained docket\nDetained Docket Control; Detention and Deportation\n\n\nAt-large arrests\nFugitive Operations; Joint Criminal Alien Response Team; Law Enforcement Area Response Units; Mobile Criminal Alien Team; Violent Criminal Alien Section"

(Hint: there are no U.S. citizens in the arrest data.)\nHow can there be arrests in the Detained Docket Control program – I thought this means that they’re already in ICE custody?\nIs it at all possible that the large number of missing final order dates refer to people who don’t have final orders of removal? If so, why are they arrested?\nHow are children handled in practice? I know the data here excludes OSS (HHS) detentions, but what happens in the arrest data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory questions\n\n\n\n\nBased on what is and is not an ERO administrative arrest, can we find “Kavanaugh stops” by looking at detentions that were not based on a) detainers, b) warrants, or c) CBP operations?\nIs there anything interesting about people who are arrested but there is no final order? This would presumably be people who have evaded the immigration system entirely, or who have run away from detention? I guess it could include people who overstayed their visas as well."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m not going to go into much detail here, but it’s worth understanding a few key things about how the immigration removal system works.\nThere are two main agencies within the Department of Homeland Security that deal with illegal immigration. Customs and Border Patrol, or CBP, only operates within 50 miles of an international border, including the coastline. The people they deal with are usually those who have crossed the border illegally, not those who have presented themselves at the border and requested asylum.\nThe other agency is Immigration and ? Enforcement, or ICE. They operate in the interior of the country and are responsible for cases that have already been heard by an immigration court judge. Immigration court is completely separate from the U.S district court or a state criminal court – it is staffed by Justice Department employees, not people who work for an independent judiciary. Its only job is to determine whether or not someone should be “removed”, or sent back to their home countries or, in rare cases, some other country.\nBoth ICE and CBP can arrest people, but they are brought to immigration, not criminal, courts and are detained by ICE, not the US Bureau of Prisons. (The people arrested may also face charge in criminal court brought by a US attorney, but that is not really part of the immigration system).\nPeople come to the removal system in several different ways:\n\nCBP transfers the person to ICE custody to face removal proceedings.\nICE gets a fingerprint match from a criminal arrest anywhere in the country by any police department, even if they entered the country legally.\nAn asylum seeker presents themselves to immigration court to ask for protection from political violence at home.\nICE conducts raids on workplaces and checks each employee’s visa status.\n\nIf an immigration judge has decided that someone should be removed, they become part of the immigration docket.\nEach of these situations is obviously a little different, but the data compiled by the Deportation Data Project generally only refers to people ICE has had some contact with , and usually only who that appear on the docket. The officers can go out looking for people who should be on their docket. They can also request cooperation from state and local authorities, or raid an area and place people on the docket who don’t have the proper authority to be here.\nHere are a few resources to learn more about how the system works:\n\nExplainer: Immigration Removal Proceedings and Expanded Mandatory Detention in the US, from The National Immigration Forum\nExplainer: How immigrants end up on ICE’s non-detained docket, from Border Report. This is broader than it seems, and requires reading all the way through because there’s a lot of “yes, but” items in it. In particular, it takes apart the claim that ICE has released tens of thousands of violent criminals because they’re not in “detention”. (Answer: They may well be in prison somewhere – they’re just not in ICE custody.)\nThe immigration court system, explained, Brennan Center for Justice"

    "text": "Immigration data projects in the wild\n\nDeportation Data Project\nThe Deportation data project is run by Graeme Blair of UCLA and David Hausman of Berkeley Law. Together, they’ve sued DHS to obtain individual-level data from ICE and CBP about encounters, arrests, detainers, detentions and removals. So far it doesn’t seem that they’ve gotten much from CBP, but they have obtained the data from ICE. It gets updated irregularly, most recently in September 2025 for data ending in July.\nWe spoke with Hausman in September, who told us a bit about the project and about some of the uses for his data. In particular, he said that news organizations had done a good job using local arrest data, for what it’s worth, but that the others take some decision-making and are a little harder. In his view, the detention data would have the most use for local reporters and is the most under-used.\nGraeme is undertaking a project to make LIONS more accessible to researchers and reporters – I’ve had one interaction with him but didn’t hear back after I responded to his message.\nThe project is currently setting up “slicers” for their data, but is not really trying to make it more accessible than that. Hausman said he would welcome any help we can give in helping reporters use it – they are getting a lot of questions and requests for help, and they can’t handle it all. They need this help more than any technical help.\nWe talked with them about how Big Local could help fill that void.\nThey have excellent documentation of the terms used in deportation datasets - it’s a great guide to what we know and what we don’t about the data.\n\n\nFollow up from symposium of reporters\nIn June, Berkeley Journalism and a few other places hosted a symposium of reporters, experts, etc. to discuss immigration reporting. Our contact there is Andrés Cediel, a documentarian with a lot of interest in immigration issues. We spoke with him on Oct 10. They want to make the data more transparent, and are focused on visualizations that could be embedded. Others who are still involved include Mark Lima of CBS and (I think) Lourdes Duarte from Chicago WGN.\nTheir inspiration was the COVID tracking project from the Atlantic.\nHis story ideas were pretty straightforward: US citizens getting caught up in raids, looking at children , those without criminal records. They are working with the Berkeley-based California News Fellowship (the group that is funded by the Calif. government to fill holes in local reporting.)\nRyan explained our model of working with a national outlet to do a story that we can help get localized by partners that we’ve worked with before, then have training materials, cleaned data, etc. to provide to anyone once we know what we’re doing. In a followup note, Andrès still seemed focused on dashboard / visualizations, but Ryan clarified that.\nHe mentioned that LAT did a good job using the data after their protests.\n\n\nGuardian US\nWill Craft, who has done a lot of work with Big Local in the past, is using the Deportation Data project pretty effectively, and is interested in being our national partner. We’re scheduled to talk with him next week.\n\n\nEnforcement dashboard\nThe immigration enforcement dashboard was initialy released in September, but includes only arrest data for the time being. The project is led by Austin Kocher an asst. research professor at Syracuse Journalism in the Office of Research and Creative Technology.1\nThere is a proof of concept at https://enforcementdashboard.com/ice-arrests/ for arrests, but it’s unclear if they are going beyond that. It’s done by Kocher’s company, Relevant Research, which also has a site called https://detentionreports.com. His numbers in detention can’t be separately sourced because he is using an imputation method to convert year-to-date averages into daily populations by month.2\nHe has gotten historical numbers by week by going to the wayback machine. ICE takes down the old links, but WAYBACK has them\nOn https://austinkocher.substack.com/ , he has done some work explaining what is in the data and what isn’t.\nThe enforcement dashboard has some issues with functionality – my guess is that although the concept worked for aggregated stats that are in the ICE detention data, it doesn’t work for datasets with way more values in it.\n\n\nOther possible sources\n\nInterest groups\n\nCato Institute, immigration project. It’s unclear who we’d want to speak with - they have several people writing articles, including Scott Lincicome and David J. Bier.

    "text": "Datasets\nThe original data was downloaded from the Deportation Data Project, as of Oct. 13, 2025 (the date of this documentation). I’ll update it when they get a new batch. I downloaded the original, not cleaned, data.\n\nAll datasets\n\n\nThe deportation data project posts five datasets: encounters, arrests, detainers, detentions, and removals. They each have their own issues, but some cross all of the datasets. They also have a list of detention sites that can be used for mapping.\nIn the data/raw folder, I’ve made an exact copy of the data that the project posts. (Most recent in most cases.) There is also a copy that I can use for hand-editing, with more descriptive data names. That’s in the data/processed folder, even though it’s raw.\nThe project is pretty good about doing basic vetting of the datasets when they arrive. For example, it immediately post the removals data from July, when they found a serious flaw. They also post when each dataset is usable as history.\nThe data originally is extracted from DHS’s Enforcement Integrated Database, or EID, which is the back end to the department’s ENFORCE application. It’s supposed to hold details on the entire enforcement infrastructure, and is supposed to contain information from all of the enforcement agencies (I think).\nThere are some things to remember about all of the datasets, and some specific to individual ones.\nOutstanding questions are shown in a callout under each section.\nThere are some definitions that are still meaningful in the paper “Piecing together the US Immigration Detention Puzzle One Night at a Time, Donald Kerwin and Daniela Alulema (Center for Migration Studies), Journal on Migration and Human Security, 2012.\n\nMost serious crime categories\nIt’s really unclear what they are using as the “most serious” crime category for the purpose of deportation. There are a couple of documents that can help:\n\nTRAC, at some point, got a list of offense codes from DHS that lists the ‘level’ of each crime, as 1, 2, or 3. We can see there that illegal entry to the US is the lowest crime category. But it doesn’t really help within the levels. (These were based on the old Morton memo, and haven’t been in use for a long time, I don’t think.)\nThe [American Immigration Council examined the “Most serious charge”]https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/enforcement_overdrive_a_comprehensive_assessment_of_ices_criminal_alien_program_final.pdf) in the Criminal Alien Program that gives some detail on what they consider more and less serious.\n\nAlso from the American Immigration Council:\n\n“Aggravated felony” is a term of art used to describe a category of offenses carrying particularly harsh immigration consequences for noncitizens convicted of such crimes. Regardless of their immigration status, noncitizens who have been convicted of an “aggravated felony” are prohibited from receiving most forms of relief that would spare them from deportation, including asylum, and from being readmitted to the United States at any time in the future.\nDespite what the ominous-sounding name may suggest, an “aggravated felony” does not require the crime to be “aggravated” or a “felony” to qualify. Instead, an “aggravated felony” is simply an offense that Congress sees fit to label as such, and today includes many nonviolent and seemingly minor offenses.\n…\nAs initially enacted in 1988, the term “aggravated felony” referred only to murder, federal drug trafficking, and illicit trafficking of certain firearms and destructive devices. Congress has since expanded the definition of “aggravated felony” on numerous occasions, but has never removed a crime from the list. Today, the definition of “aggravated felony” covers more than thirty types of offenses, including simple battery, theft, filing a false tax return, and failing to appear in court.\n\nUSCIS has a list of aggravated felonies on its website, but I’m not sure how up to date it is.\nYou can also be deported for crimes of “moral turpitude”.\n(The reason this matters is that it goes into the “most serious” crime category, I think.)\nThe ICE custody worksheet suggests that the most serious crime conviction is based on the sentence, and nothing else: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-standards/2011/2-2.pdf\n\n\nDuplications\nThere are apparent duplications in each dataset. Some are not truly dupes but are different events. For example, a single person arrested can have a series of detention records as they are moved around by ICE. Some are just mysterious. I’m handling different situations in different ways, documented here.\n\n\nMissing unique identifiers\nICE is supposed to provide a scrambled unique identifier for each person but there are quite a few missing.\n\n\nFamous cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\n\nGet a list of famous cases that should be followed through the system\n\nMoving around detention\nArrest at courthouse\nUS citizens\nDeaths\nChildren\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nIs the unique identifier the same over time?\nWhat is the impact of this coming from ICE’s Integrated Enforcement Database?

    "text": "The deportation data project posts five datasets: encounters, arrests, detainers, detentions, and removals. They also have a list of offices scraped from the sub-office website of ICE.\nIn the data/raw folder, I’ve made an exact copy of the data that the project posts. (Most recent in most cases.) There is also a copy that I can use for hand-editing, with more descriptive data names. That’s in the data/processed folder, even though it’s raw.\nThe project is pretty good about doing basic vetting of the datasets when they arrive. For example, it immediately post the removals data from July, when they found a serious flaw. They also post when each dataset is usable as history.\nThe data originally is extracted from DHS’s Enforcement Integrated Database, or EID, which is the back end to the department’s ENFORCE application. It’s supposed to hold details on the entire enforcement infrastructure, and is supposed to contain information from all of the enforcement agencies (I think).\nThe original data was downloaded from the Deportation Data Project, as of Oct. 13, 2025 (the date of this documentation). I’ll update it when they get a new batch. I downloaded the original, not cleaned, data.\nThere are some things to remember about all of the datasets, and some specific to individual ones."

    "text": "Questions on common categories\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\n\nDecide how to deal with crime codes so they’re collapsed into meaningful categories that would be able to be used in a sentence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nCan we say that someone was only convicted of immigration offenses if that is the most serious crime? How can we characterize that?\n\n\n\n\nMost serious crime categories\nIt’s really unclear what is considered the “most serious” crime. In particular, it’s unclear whether any immigration offense, such as illegal entry, is considered more serious than, say, a DUI.\n\nTRAC, at some point, got a list of offense codes from DHS that lists the ‘level’ of each crime, as 1, 2, or 3. We can see there that illegal entry to the US is the lowest crime category. But it doesn’t really help within the levels. (These were based on the old Morton memo, and haven’t been in use for a long time, I don’t think.)\nThe American Immigration Council examined the “Most serious charge” in the Criminal Alien Program that gives some detail on what they consider more and less serious.\n\nAlso from the American Immigration Council:\n\n“Aggravated felony” is a term of art used to describe a category of offenses carrying particularly harsh immigration consequences for noncitizens convicted of such crimes. Regardless of their immigration status, noncitizens who have been convicted of an “aggravated felony” are prohibited from receiving most forms of relief that would spare them from deportation, including asylum, and from being readmitted to the United States at any time in the future.\nDespite what the ominous-sounding name may suggest, an “aggravated felony” does not require the crime to be “aggravated” or a “felony” to qualify. Instead, an “aggravated felony” is simply an offense that Congress sees fit to label as such, and today includes many nonviolent and seemingly minor offenses.\n…\nAs initially enacted in 1988, the term “aggravated felony” referred only to murder, federal drug trafficking, and illicit trafficking of certain firearms and destructive devices. Congress has since expanded the definition of “aggravated felony” on numerous occasions, but has never removed a crime from the list. Today, the definition of “aggravated felony” covers more than thirty types of offenses, including simple battery, theft, filing a false tax return, and failing to appear in court.\n\n\nUSCIS has a list of aggravated felonies on its website, but I’m not sure how up to date it is.) (You can also be deported for crimes of “moral turpitude”.)\n\n\nThe ICE custody worksheet suggests that the most serious crime conviction is based on the sentence, and nothing else: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-standards/2011/2-2.pdf"

For example, a person could be arrested twice, or they will show up over and over in the detention data. In each dataset, we can decide how to handle them for the purpose of local reporting. Using the same example in detention, for example, might mean that we want to create a snapshot for each detention location that has anyone who was ever in that area. For arrests, we may only want to keep the most recent OR we may want to create some summaries of arrests, and summaries of people, separately.\nDuplicates across all fields, including missing values. Just save one – it doesn’t matter which.\n\n\n\nHard answers\n\nDupes that appear to be the same, but have different information. An example is an arrest record that differs in most cells, but has the same unique person ID and the same date and time as others. One answer is to look at the order that the file came in, and choose the one that appears to be the most recent (top or bottom of list in their original order), or see whether one of the values suggests it is a record that SHOULD be deleted (entered in error).\n\n\n\n\nMissing unique identifiers\nICE is supposed to provide a scrambled unique identifier for each person but there are quite a few missing.\n\n\nDates and times\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\n\nAdd a “clean date” field to each dataset where it looks like we need it. Here, we can change entries that are clearly the wrong century to the right one and delete the dates that are most obviously wrong.\nSeparate date and time fields where it’s important. There are times that reporters will want to use the date only and it’s hard for them using date-time combinations."
